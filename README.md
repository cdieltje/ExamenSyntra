### Set up your virtual environment
- Import 'environment.yaml' (in the same folder as 'README.md'), e.g. with Anaconda Navigator -> Environments -> Import
- Start -> Anaconda Powershell Prompt -> typ: "conda activate environment" (in case 'environment' is the name of the environment you just imported)
- Next, still in Anaconda Powershell Prompt, typ: "jupyter notebook", in order to open jupyter notebook.

### Run the notebooks to test the project
- You can find the notebooks in the subfolder 'notebooks' of the project folder.
- The notebooks use scripts from the folder 'scripts'.
- In case you downloaded the project from Github, you still need to add data to the data/input folder.

### The scripts that are used by the notebook:
- 

### Problems with running the notebook? To get an idea of what we did, you can take a look at:
- An HTML file of the notebooks in the folder 'notebooks'
- Output files in the folder 'data\output'
- The scripts in the folder 'scripts'. We provided each function with a clear docstring.
- In case something isn't clear: contact us via email carlo.dieltjens@gmail.com
